              <span class="content">
                <p>Network marketing, also known as multi-level marketing (MLM), is a business model that relies on a network of distributors to sell products directly to consumers. In this business model, individuals are incentivized to recruit other individuals to become distributors, forming a "downline" that can earn commissions on the sales made by the downline. </p>

                <h5>Is network marketing a pyramid or get-rich quick scheme?</h5>
                <span><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-lg"></i></span>
              </span>
              <span class="content">
                <p>No, network marketing is not a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are illegal and involve recruiting others to invest money with the promise of high returns without any real product or service being offered. In network marketing, distributors earn commissions on the sales of products, and the business model is legal and legitimate.</p>

              </span>
              <span class="content">
                <p>Yes, anyone can do network marketing. However, it does require a certain level of sales skills, self-motivation, and persistence. If you're not comfortable with selling products or recruiting others to join your team, network marketing may not be the best fit for you.</p>

              </span>
              <span class="content">
                <p>There is no limit to how much money you can make in network marketing. Your income is directly tied to your level of effort and success in building your downline and selling products. However, it's important to remember that success is not guaranteed, and it takes hard work and dedication to build a successful network marketing business.</p>

                <span class="content">
                <p>No, network marketing is not a scam. However, like any business opportunity, there are some companies that operate unethically or deceptively. It's important to thoroughly research any network marketing opportunity before investing time and money into it. Look for red flags such as companies that focus more on recruiting new distributors than selling products to customers.</p>
